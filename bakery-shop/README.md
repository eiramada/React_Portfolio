# Developer Task

### The Story
Your friend Lisa finally made her lifelong dream come true and started her own bakery shop a few months ago. As the business was doing really well and the workload had been increasing significantly, Lisa wanted to have a website showing an overview of the shop’s products and employees. At first, Lisa started developing the website herself but did not have enough time to complete everything because of her busy schedule. Knowing that you have experience in software development, she has asked for your help to finish and modify some things on the website.

### Setup
To start this application, you need to install Node.js (version 12+) from [Node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once installed, go to the bakery-shop directory and run the `npm install` command to install the project dependencies then run `npm start` to begin the application.

After the last command, the application should open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Assignment
Start by familiarizing yourself with the application and its code. Lisa has left some TODOs in the code to make it easier for you.

1. At the moment, the “Employees” view displays static data. You need to make it load and display data from the backend service and add a column for an avatar (note that the avatar should be displayed as an image). The URL to load data is `https://reqres.in/api/users`.
The data you receive will be in the format you see below:

```json
{
  "page": "2",
  "per_page": 2,
  "total": 12,
  "total_pages": 6,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 3,
      "email": "emma.wong@reqres.in",
      "first_name": "Emma",
      "last_name": "Wong",
      "avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/olegpogodaev/128.jpg"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
      "first_name": "Eve",
      "last_name": "Holt",
      "avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/marcoramires/128.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
```
2. The “Add” and “Delete” buttons of the “Employees” view do not work. Add an option to add and delete an employee from the list.
    a. The backend APIs are not ready yet, so just add/remove the employee from the table.
    b. Add the following validations to the new employee input form (You can use external libraries e.g. [validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator)):
    - **ID**: required and contains only numbers
    - **Name**: required and contains only letters
    - **Email**: required and matches a valid email pattern
    - **Avatar**: required

**Bonus task**: Display appropriate user error messages below the input fields.

3. Lisa wants to make specific table fields stand out more. Change the following column styles:
    - Set the font weight of the first table column to bold across the whole application.
    - Display the quantity of the product in red if it is fewer than three (3) pieces.

4. Currently, it takes time to understand which products are the least and most expensive. Order the products by price from lowest to highest.
