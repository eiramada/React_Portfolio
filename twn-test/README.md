# Proovitoo Project

## Introduction

The Proovitoo project or twn-test is designed to showcase the implementation of various coding tasks and challenges. It serves as a demonstration of technical skills and problem-solving abilities.
Project information is available here: 
https://proovitoo.twn.ee/intro

## Features

- **Task Management**: Organize and manage coding tasks efficiently.
- **Code Examples**: Provide clear and well-documented code examples.
- **Article View**: Fetch and display articles in a simple view.
- **Table View**: Display fetched data in a table with sorting and pagination.

## Functional Requirements

### Article View
- Perform a query and display the obtained result.

### Table View
- Display the obtained result in table rows.
- Implement 3-step sorting (Ascending, Descending, Default) for the table.
- Include pagination similar to the one on the Proovitoo project page.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Use Vue, React, or Angular framework.
- Avoid external modules for paginator, table sorter, etc.
- Design does not need to match the Proovitoo page exactly but mimicking it is beneficial.
